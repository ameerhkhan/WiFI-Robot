This project must accomplish the following goals,

1 - Control a small scale vehicle over Wi-Fi
2 - Stream video with real time object detection.

Hardware to be used,
- Raspberry Pi 3.
- Pi NoIR Camera.
- L293d H-Bridge Motor Driver
- R/C Car with motor and battery.
- Servo motor for steering.
- Ultrasonic sensor.
- Arduino for controlling the motors.

Project Overview,

The aim of this project is to develop a rover which can be controlled over wifi while being able to provide a
livestream of the environment using an onboard camera.

In the video stream, the system should show objects detected using object detection via deep learning.
An ultrasonic sensor should also give out the distance to the object in its path.

Project Breakdown,
Server side,
A program running on the server should be able to display the stream as well as the controls for controlling the vehicle.
The server should store all the objects detected in a csv file along with a timestamp.
Object detection will also be performed server side for faster processing. Limited processing power on the Raspberry Pi
would hamper the overall performance of the system.

Raspberry Pi side,
The Pi will be responsible for moving the vehicle while streaming the video as well.
The Pi will be connected to an Arduino that will receive commands from the Pi and run the driving motor as well as the servo
accordingly.
The pi will also take note of values coming from the ultrasonic sensor to avoid any collision with an object.


More points will be added as they come by.
